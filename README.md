# Adwaita Symbolic

Adwaita's symbolic icons packaged & distributed via npm.

## Gecko variant
The `gecko/` folder of this package includes icons generated specificly for use within Gecko applications. They will only work in contexts where [`-moz-context-properties`](https://udn.realityripple.com/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-context-properties) is available. This is generally for files served via `chrome://` or `resource://`.
